# üõ°Ô∏è Playbook: Malware Detection and Response

## Overview  
Steps to identify, isolate, and remediate malware infections on endpoints to minimize impact.

## Detection  
- Alerts from EDR/AV tools (CrowdStrike, Windows Defender)  
- Unusual system behavior (CPU spikes, crashes)  
- Network traffic anomalies

## Response Steps  
1. **Confirm malware presence**  
   - Use AV scans and EDR telemetry  
2. **Isolate affected systems**  
   - Disconnect from network to prevent spread  
3. **Analyze malware**  
   - Collect samples and investigate IOC  
4. **Eradicate malware**  
   - Run full malware removal tools and clean infected files  
5. **Recovery**  
   - Restore systems from clean backups if needed  
   - Patch vulnerabilities exploited  
6. **Post-Incident**  
   - Document findings and update detection signatures  
   - Conduct user awareness if infection vector is known
