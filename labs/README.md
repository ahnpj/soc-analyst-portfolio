# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Analyst Labs Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs I‚Äôve built to practice **SIEM analysis, network traffic investigation, scanning/recon, and playbook documentation**.  
Each lab is designed to **increase in complexity and depth as the lab number goes up**. For example, `Lab01` focuses on introductory concepts, while `Lab02` and higher require more advanced investigation, correlation, and analysis skills.

## üéØ Skills Demonstrated
- **Progression of difficulty**: Labs are numbered so complexity builds over time (Lab01 = fundamentals ‚Üí Lab02+ = deeper, real-world investigations).  
- SIEM log analysis (Splunk, ELK concepts)  
- Threat detection & hunting (VPN anomalies, suspicious processes)  
- Network traffic analysis fundamentals  
- Documentation of repeatable **SOC playbooks**  
- Clear technical communication for both technical and non-technical audiences

## üöÄ How to Use
- Browse the `labs/` folder to view individual exercises.  
- Each lab includes:
  - Step-by-step procedure  
  - Screenshots (`images/`)  
  - Findings & conclusions  
- To understand skill progression:
  - **Start with lower-numbered labs (Lab01)** for fundamentals.  
  - **Move to higher-numbered labs (Lab02, Lab03, ‚Ä¶)** to see more advanced detection and analysis scenarios.  

---

## üìå Next Steps
- Adding **Wireshark labs** (packet capture & analysis).  
- Expanding **Nmap labs** for recon & vulnerability scanning.  
- More advanced SOC scenarios (alert triage, correlation rules, incident response).

## üí° About
This repo is part of my ongoing transition into cybersecurity, showcasing practical hands-on experience that aligns with **SOC analyst / blue team roles**.  
By structuring labs in increasing difficulty, I aim to show not only **technical skills**, but also **progression and growth** in real-world SOC analyst workflows.
