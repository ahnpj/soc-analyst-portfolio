# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my SOC Analyst Portfolio!  
This repo is where I collect the hands-on work I‚Äôve been doing to build practical blue team skills. My focus is on learning how to think and work like a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst ‚Äî investigating alerts, analyzing logs, and documenting clear playbooks.

This is a **work in progress** ‚Äî I‚Äôm continuing to add more labs and examples as I go. What you see here will grow over time, with each lab building in complexity and depth (Lab01 = fundamentals, Lab02+ = more advanced scenarios).

## What‚Äôs Inside

## Skills Demonstrated

- Reading and analyzing SIEM logs (Splunk, general SIEM concepts)  
- Identifying suspicious or abnormal activity  
- Writing structured investigation notes and playbooks  
- Documenting technical work clearly for others to follow  
- Building up complexity across labs (introductory ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí advanced)  

---

## Roadmap / Coming Soon

This repo will continue to grow as I add more content, including:  
- Additional SIEM labs (ELK stack, more Splunk scenarios)  
- Network analysis labs (Wireshark, packet capture)  
- Scanning/recon labs (Nmap, basic vulnerability discovery)  
- Expanded incident response playbooks

## üí° Note

All work here is practice and simulation ‚Äî no real company data is included.  
I‚Äôm using this repo to document my learning journey and showcase how I approach **SOC analyst tasks step by step**. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
