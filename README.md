SOC Analyst Portfolio
Hey there! Welcome to my SOC Analyst Portfolio — this is where I share the hands-on stuff I’ve been working on to get ready for a real Security Operations Center role.

Inside, you’ll find everything from sample incident reports to playbooks and labs that show how I approach threat detection, incident response, and general blue team work.

What’s Inside?
incident-reports/
Realistic write-ups where I walk through how I’d handle things like phishing attempts, suspicious logins, or malware alerts — kind of like the reports you’d write after investigating an incident.

playbooks/
Step-by-step guides I put together for handling common security problems. Think of these as cheat sheets or recipes for how to respond when certain alerts pop up.

log-analysis-exercises/
Examples of digging into logs to find bad stuff. These are practice exercises where I look for weird activity and write down what I find.

labs-and-projects/
Hands-on stuff from platforms like TryHackMe or virtual labs I set up myself. Includes screenshots, notes, and walkthroughs of what I learned.

What Skills Does This Show?
Reading and analyzing SIEM logs

Hunting for threats and suspicious behavior

Writing clear incident reports

Breaking down phishing and malware cases

Basic scripting (PowerShell & Bash)

Using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK

Documenting work clearly for teammates

About Me
I’m an aspiring SOC analyst who’s passionate about cybersecurity and learning all the things that keep companies safe. This repo is my way of showing I’m serious about the work and ready to jump in.

A Few Notes
Everything here is practice or simulated — no real company data.
