# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my SOC Analyst Portfolio!  
This repo is where I collect the hands-on work I’ve been doing to build practical blue team skills. My focus is on learning how to think and work like a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst — investigating alerts, analyzing logs, and documenting clear playbooks.

This is a **work in progress** — I’m continuing to add more labs and examples as I go. What you see here will grow over time, with each lab building in complexity and depth (Lab01 = fundamentals, Lab02+ = more advanced scenarios).

## 📂 What’s Inside

- **playbooks/**  
  Step-by-step response guides I’ve written for common security events.  
  These are structured like SOC playbooks to help with incident triage, investigation, and response.  

- **labs/**  
  Hands-on labs where I dig into SIEM data, practice log analysis, and build investigation workflows.  
  Currently includes:
    - SIEM
        - SIEM Basics
            - **[Lab01 – Suspicious Process Investigation](labs/siem/siem-basics/Lab01-suspicious-process-investigation/Lab01-suspicious-process-investigation.md)**  
  *Level: Beginner* → Investigating abnormal process activity in logs, understanding correlation rules.
        - Splunk
            - **[Lab01 – Splunk VPN Log Analysis](labs/siem/splunk/Lab01-splunk-vpn-log-analysis/Lab01-splunk-vpn-log-analysis.md)**  
  *Level: Beginner* → Detecting unusual VPN login activity, analyzing login patterns by user and source country, and identifying suspicious travel or account compromise.
            - **[Lab01 – Splunk Data Manipulation](labs/siem/splunk/Lab02-splunk-data-manipulation/Lab02-splunk-data-manipulation-basics.md)**  
  *Level: Beginner* → Understanding how Splunk processes, parses, and manipulates machine-generated data using configuration files (inputs.conf, props.conf, transforms.conf) to ensure accurate field extraction and reliable analysis for security investigations.

    - Endpoint Triage
        - Windows CMD/CLI
          - **[Lab01 – Windows CMD/CLI Basics](labs/endpoint-triage/windows-cli/Lab01-windows-cli-endpoint-triage-basics/Lab01-windows-cli-endpoint-triage-basics.md)**  
  *Level: Beginner* → Using Windows command-line tools to investigate processes, review system information, and identify suspicious activity.
        - PowerShell
          - **[Lab01 – PowerShell Basics](labs/endpoint-triage/powershell/Lab01-powershell-endpoint-triage-basics/Lab01-powershell-endpoint-triage.basics.md)**  
  *Level: Beginner* → Leveraging PowerShell commands to collect endpoint data, filter logs, and detect potential anomalies in process execution.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

- Reading and analyzing SIEM logs (Splunk, general SIEM concepts)  
- Identifying suspicious or abnormal activity  
- Writing structured investigation notes and playbooks  
- Documenting technical work clearly for others to follow  
- Building up complexity across labs (introductory → intermediate → advanced)

## 🚀 Roadmap / Coming Soon

This repo will continue to grow as I add more content, including:  
- Additional SIEM labs (ELK stack, more Splunk scenarios)  
- Network analysis labs (Wireshark, packet capture)  
- Scanning/recon labs (Nmap, basic vulnerability discovery)  
- Expanded incident response playbooks

## 💡 Note

All work here is practice and simulation — no real company data is included.  
I’m using this repo to document my learning journey and showcase how I approach **SOC analyst tasks step by step**. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
