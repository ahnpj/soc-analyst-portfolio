# SOC Analyst Portfolio
Hey there! Welcome to my SOC Analyst Portfolio â€” this is where I share the hands-on stuff Iâ€™ve been working on to get ready for a real Security Operations Center role. Inside, youâ€™ll find everything from sample incident reports to playbooks and labs that show how I approach threat detection, incident response, and general blue team work.

**Whatâ€™s Inside?**<br>
incident-reports/
Realistic write-ups where I walk through how Iâ€™d handle things like phishing attempts, suspicious logins, or malware alerts â€” kind of like the reports youâ€™d write after investigating an incident.

playbooks/
Step-by-step guides I put together for handling common security problems. Think of these as cheat sheets or recipes for how to respond when certain alerts pop up.

log-analysis-exercises/
Examples of digging into logs to find bad stuff. These are practice exercises where I look for weird activity and write down what I find.

labs-and-projects/
Hands-on stuff from platforms like TryHackMe or virtual labs I set up myself. Includes screenshots, notes, and walkthroughs of what I learned.

What Skills Does This Show?
Reading and analyzing SIEM logs

Hunting for threats and suspicious behavior

Writing clear incident reports

Breaking down phishing and malware cases

Basic scripting (PowerShell & Bash)

Using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK

Documenting work clearly for teammates

About Me
Iâ€™m an aspiring SOC analyst whoâ€™s passionate about cybersecurity and learning all the things that keep companies safe. This repo is my way of showing Iâ€™m serious about the work and ready to jump in.

A Few Notes
Everything here is practice or simulated â€” no real company data.

Iâ€™m always open to feedback or collaboration, so feel free to reach out!
