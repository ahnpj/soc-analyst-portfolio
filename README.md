# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my SOC Analyst Portfolio!
<br></br>
This repo is where I collect the hands-on work I‚Äôve been doing to build practical blue team skills. My focus is on learning how to think and work like a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst ‚Äî investigating alerts, analyzing logs, and documenting clear playbooks.

This is a **work in progress** ‚Äî I‚Äôm continuing to add more labs and examples as I go. 

**Note:** What you see here will grow over time, with each lab building in complexity and depth (Lab01 = fundamentals, Lab02+ = more advanced scenarios).

## What‚Äôs Inside

<h3>Labs ‚Üí (labs/)</h3> Hands-on labs where I dig into SIEM data, practice log analysis, and build investigation workflows. 
Currently includes:
<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary><b>SIEM</b></summary>

> <details>
> <summary>SIEM Basics</summary>
>
> - <a href="labs/siem/siem-basics/Lab01-intro-to-siem/Lab01-suspicious-process-investigation.md">Lab01 ‚Äì Suspicious Process Investigation</a><br/>
>   <em>Level: Beginner</em> ‚Üí Investigating abnormal process activity in logs, understanding correlation rules.
>
> </details>

> <details>
> <summary>Splunk</summary>
>
> - <a href="labs/siem/splunk/Lab01-splunk-vpn-log-analysis/Lab01-splunk-vpn-log-analysis-basics.md">Lab01 ‚Äì Splunk VPN Log Analysis</a><br/>
>   <em>Level: Beginner</em> ‚Üí Detecting unusual VPN login activity, analyzing login patterns by user and source country, and identifying suspicious travel or account compromise.
> - <a href="labs/siem/splunk/Lab02-splunk-data-manipulation/Lab02-splunk-data-manipulation-basics.md">Lab02 ‚Äì Splunk Data Manipulation</a><br/>
>   <em>Level: Beginner</em> ‚Üí Understanding how Splunk processes, parses, and manipulates machine-generated data using configuration files (inputs.conf, props.conf, transforms.conf) to ensure accurate field extraction and reliable analysis for security investigations.
>- <a href="labs/siem/splunk/Lab03-splunk-cyber-kill-chain-investigation/Lab03-splunk-cyber-kill-chain-investigation.md">Lab03 ‚Äì Splunk Cyber Kill Chain Investigation</a><br/>
>   <em>Level: Intermediate</em> ‚Üí Performing a complete investigation of a simulated web server defacement incident by tracing attacker activity through each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain. This includes identifying reconnaissance behavior, analyzing exploit attempts, verifying malware installation, and uncovering command-and-control (C2) communication using Splunk queries and network log data. The lab emphasizes the analytical workflow of a SOC analyst ‚Äî from detecting the initial compromise to mapping adversary TTPs against frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and NIST SP 800-61. Learners will gain hands-on experience correlating IDS alerts, HTTP traffic, and DNS records to produce actionable intelligence and document incident findings in a professional, report-ready format.

## Note

All work here is practice and simulation ‚Äî no real company data is included.
<br></br>
I‚Äôm using this repo to document my learning journey and showcase how I approach **SOC analyst tasks step by step**. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
