# Cybersecurity & IT Operations Portfolio

Welcome to the part of my GitHub where I’m teaching myself how to work across cybersecurity and IT operations. Nothing here is meant to look perfect. It’s basically where I learn by doing — breaking things, fixing them, chasing weird logs, and slowly figuring out how real investigations and day-to-day IT work actually feel.

This repo is my running record of that process. I’m practicing everything from SIEM searches and log analysis to scripting, network traffic reviews, and basic system administration tasks. Some labs go smoothly, some definitely don’t, but that’s the whole point — I want to understand how things really behave, not just how they’re “supposed” to work.

You’ll notice the labs are numbered. That’s intentional.
They follow the order I wanted to learn things:

Early labs = fundamentals

Later labs = more noise, more steps, more pivot points, more places to get things wrong

As the numbers go up, the investigations start to feel more real: multi-stage activity, correlating different log sources, piecing timelines together, tuning searches, checking assumptions, and actually explaining what happened instead of just guessing.

## What’s Inside

<h3>Labs → (labs/)</h3> Hands-on labs covering cybersecurity, IT ops, scripting, and investigation-style problem solving. Each one walks through what I saw, what I thought it meant, what actually happened, and how I figured it out. Some are quick. Some took forever. All of them taught me something.

>- <a href="labs/siem/splunk/Lab03-splunk-cyber-kill-chain-investigation/Lab03-splunk-cyber-kill-chain-investigation.md">Lab03 – Splunk Cyber Kill Chain Investigation</a><br/>
>   <em>Level: Intermediate</em> → Performing a complete investigation of a simulated web server defacement incident by tracing attacker activity through each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain. This includes identifying reconnaissance behavior, analyzing exploit attempts, verifying malware installation, and uncovering command-and-control (C2) communication using Splunk queries and network log data. The lab emphasizes the analytical workflow of a SOC analyst — from detecting the initial compromise to mapping adversary TTPs against frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and NIST SP 800-61. Learners will gain hands-on experience correlating IDS alerts, HTTP traffic, and DNS records to produce actionable intelligence and document incident findings in a professional, report-ready format.
>- <a href="labs/siem/splunk/Lab04-splunk-backdoor-and-registry-hunt/Lab04-splunk-backdoor-and-registry-hunt.md">Lab04 – Splunk Backdoor and Registry Hunt</a><br/>
>   <em>Level: Advanced</em> → This lab walks through a full investigation of malicious activity using Splunk, including identifying backdoor account creation, registry modifications, remote WMIC abuse, and encoded PowerShell payloads. I traced attacker actions across multiple event sources (Security, Sysmon, and PowerShell logs), used host-based filtering to pinpoint suspicious activity, and decoded multi-layer Base64 payloads to uncover the final callback URL. The lab demonstrates how to think like an analyst: pivoting between events, validating assumptions, decoding obfuscated commands, and connecting evidence across hosts to reconstruct the adversary’s behavior.

## Note

This repo exists so I can learn, stay consistent, and get better at security and IT operational work over time.
