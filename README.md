# SOC Analyst Portfolio
Hey there! Welcome to my SOC Analyst Portfolio — this is where I share the hands-on stuff I’ve been working on to get ready for a real Security Operations Center role. Inside, you’ll find everything from sample incident reports to playbooks and labs that show how I approach threat detection, incident response, and general blue team work. This repo is my way of showing I’m serious about the work and ready to jump in.

**What’s Inside?**<br>

* incident-reports/<br>
Realistic write-ups where I walk through how I’d handle things like phishing attempts, suspicious logins, or malware alerts — kind of like the reports you’d write after investigating an incident.

* playbooks/<br>
Step-by-step guides I put together for handling common security problems. Think of these as cheat sheets or recipes for how to respond when certain alerts pop up.

* log-analysis-exercises/<br>
Examples of digging into logs to find bad stuff. These are practice exercises where I look for weird activity and write down what I find.

* labs-and-projects/<br>
Hands-on stuff from platforms like TryHackMe or virtual labs I set up myself. Includes screenshots, notes, and walkthroughs of what I learned.

**What Skills Does This Show?**<br>
* Reading and analyzing SIEM logs<br>

* Hunting for threats and suspicious behavior<br>

* Writing clear incident reports<br>

* Breaking down phishing and malware cases<br>

* Basic scripting (PowerShell & Bash)<br>

* Using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK<br>

* Documenting work clearly for teammates<br>

**A Few Notes**<br>
* Everything here is practice or simulated — no real company data.<br>

* I’m always open to feedback or collaboration, so feel free to reach out!<br>
